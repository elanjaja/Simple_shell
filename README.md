A simple shell in C programming refers to a basic implementation of a command-line interpreter, akin to a minimal version of the Unix shell (like Bash or sh). A shell is a program that provides an interface for users to interact with an operating system by taking commands as inputs, executing them, and displaying the output to the user.

A simple shell typically performs the following basic functionalities:

Command Execution: It interprets user-entered commands and executes them. For instance, it can handle simple commands like ls, pwd, cd, etc.

Parsing: It reads user input, tokenizes it, and identifies the command and its arguments. It separates the command and its arguments, ensuring that the appropriate program is invoked with the correct parameters.

Environment Management: It handles environment variables that store information like paths, user settings, etc.

I/O Redirection and Piping: It supports input/output redirection and piping for chaining multiple commands together.
